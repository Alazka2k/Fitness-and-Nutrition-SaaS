```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Development

This project uses a `Build.ps1` PowerShell script to manage common development tasks.

### Available Commands

- Setup: `poetry run build setup`
- Run tests: `poetry run build test`
- Lint code: `poetry run build lint`
- Format code: `poetry run build format`
- Show all available tasks: `poetry run build help`

### Running Tests

To run tests:

```
poetry run pytest
```

### Adding Dependencies

To add a new dependency:

```
poetry add <package-name>
```

For development dependencies:

```
poetry add --dev <package-name>
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency. The following hooks are configured:

1. **pre-commit-hooks:**

   - `trailing-whitespace`: Removes trailing whitespace.
   - `end-of-file-fixer`: Ensures files end with a newline.
   - `check-yaml`: Checks YAML files for syntax errors.
   - `check-added-large-files`: Prevents giant files from being committed.

2. **black:** Formats Python code to adhere to the Black code style.

3. **flake8:** Checks Python code for style and quality issues.

4. **prettier:** Formats various file types for consistent style.

To install the pre-commit hooks, run:

```
pre-commit install
```

These hooks will run automatically on every commit. You can also run them manually on all files with:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```
